I'm **Amit Khurana**, a software engineer wrangling code at Google.

## What I Do

I'm part of the **Kythe team**, working on the [Kythe open-source project](https://github.com/kythe/kythe). We help developers navigate code with the grace of a hummingbird (or at least that's the goal!). Think of us as the GPS for your codebase, making sure you never get lost in the lines of logic.


## Projects

- [**Kythe**](https://github.com/kythe/kythe) - Open-source project for code navigation (and my main squeeze 🐦).

## Always Learning...

☕  Right now, I'm on a quest to master the art of making the perfect cup of filter coffee (because caffeine is essential for wrangling code). 

📸  In my free time, I'm also trying to capture the world's beauty, one photo at a time.

## Feel Free to Reach Out!

Up for a chat about Kythe, code, filter coffee, or photography? Hit me up!
